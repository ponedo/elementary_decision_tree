# elementary_decision_tree
A really simple decision tree I've learned in machine learning class.

This is a decision tree in basic form.

What it can do:
  1. Classify samples in a dataset like the file "wine_data.txt"[1];
  2. Handle not only discrete values but also continuous ones;
  3. Self-test by cross validation or bootstrapping, achieved in test_lib.py.
  
How to improve:
  1. Prune!
  2. Eliminate the randomness of the algorithm by some means;
  3. Improve some formulas.

[1]"wine_data.txt": A dataset acquired in UCI archive. "wine_descryption" explains the data format.
